Mini Project: Guess the Random Number (1–20) 
Developed an interactive number guessing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application generates a random number between 1 and 20, and users can input their guesses. The system provides real-time feedback for correct and incorrect attempts, along with score tracking.
Key Highlights:
Random number generation and validation using JavaScript
Interactive UI with a Batman-themed design
Dynamic feedback for correct and wrong guesses
Responsive and beginner-friendly layout with CSS
This project helped strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and UI/UX design. It demonstrates how simple web technologies can be combined to create an engaging and interactive user experience.
